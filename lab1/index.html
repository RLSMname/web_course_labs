          <h4>When did Christmas cake originate?</h4>
          <p>
            Christmas cake is a fairly modern addition to the festive dessert
            table. The fruity, iced cake that we eat around Christmas time now
            actually replaced the more traditional ‘Twelfth Cake’ from the late
            19th century, which was eaten at the feast of Epiphany when the
            Christmas season drew to a close.

          <h4>The most candles on a cake</h4>
          <p>
            The world record for the largest number of candles on a birthday
            cake was set in 2016 by Ashrita Furman and the Sri Chinmoy Centre in
            New York, when 72,585 candles were lit. The cake was created to
            celebrate the birthday of meditation teacher Sri Chinmoy on his 85th
            birthday and 100 members of the centre came together to achieve the
            world record.

              It’s a rich, moist cake made with carrots and spices covered in
              cream cheese frosting. This cake is infused with warm flavors like
              cinnamon, ginger, and nutmeg.

              It has layers of fluffy chocolate sponge, whipped cream, and a
              cherry filling. This cake is infused with cherry liqueur, bringing
              a richer and deeper flavor.

            <td>
              This vibrant sponge has a unique flavor that’s somewhere between
              chocolate and vanilla. The color was once a natural reaction
              between the cocoa and the buttermilk in the batter. Now it’s the
              result of food coloring.
